"Next, we prepared some simple exercises for you. The exercises are in the LifewareHR package, already open down here. There are two classes, CarRental and Car, and a Test class, CarRentalTest. The exercises are described in the CarRentalTest class. If you are a software engineer you will probably find them easy, if you have no technical background they may be difficult. Try to solve them (some of them, all of them, as you prefer), then we will discuss  your solutions, and possible extensions, in the next interview.If you have any question don't hesitate to get in touch with us at hresource@lifeware.ch"CarRentalTest browse.
